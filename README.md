# CaptialCountryGuesser

This application was a game that I created in my Programming for Mobile Computing class that I took in my first year. Essentially the game works by having the program ask for either a capital city of the country it generates, or a country for the capital that it generates. After you guessed, it will give you a point if you guessed correctly or none if you got it wrong. It will continue by asking you a new question.
